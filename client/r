<h3> The need of WebSockets and WebRTC ( short summary )</h3> 

> What's the best application level protocol for enabling a bidirectional communication channel(i.e both client and server can update each other at any time) ?. HTTP works fine when the client has to request data fewer times. HTTP opens up a connection and closes the connection as soon as it gets required response. In case of a chat application we continuously need to listen for data from server, one solution is keep requesting the server for data every few milliseconds, but its resource consuming for both the sides. The solution is WebSockets, it enables a full-duplex bidirectional communication, that is, the client is always ready to listen for data pushed by server. 
But WebSockets are still not peer to peer, in case of audio/video streaming between multiple peers, creating a direct peer to peer connection is a better option (because loads of data is being streamed), but this is also one of the most difficult things to do. WebRTC helps us create a direct peer to peer connetion. WebRTC is one of the most complex communication protocols because it tries all possible ways to create a peer - peer connection, if it still fails then the data is relayed via a TURN server.

<h3> Pull Request </h3> 
  
  Steps for pull request are a bit different than installation mentioned above. 
  
  > <li> Fork the repo </li>
  > <li> Clone the forked repo locally using git clone ==> git clone forked_repo_link.git </li>
  > <li> Checkout to a new branch, name it appropriately ==> git checkout -b new-feature-xyz  </li>
  > <li> Make the changes and commit them </li>
  > <li> Push changes to the forked repo ==> git push origin </li>
  > <li> Start a pull  request ==> After pushing, you will see a Compare and Pull Request button on forked repo </li>
